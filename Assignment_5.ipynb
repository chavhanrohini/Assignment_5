    "## 3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?\n",
    "The most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list in Python is how they store and retrieve data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tStorage of Data:\n",
    "•\tList: A list is an ordered collection of items. It stores elements in a sequential manner, and each element is accessed by its index (position) within the list. Lists are indexed using integer values, starting from 0.\n",
    "•\tDictionary: A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Instead of using indices, data in a dictionary is accessed by its associated key. Each key is unique within the dictionary, and it maps to a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tAccessing Data:\n",
    "•\tList: In a list, you access elements by their position (index) in the list. For example, `my_list[0]` accesses the first element of the list.\n",
    "•\tDictionary: In a dictionary, you access data by specifying the key associated with it. For example, `my_dict['key']` retrieves the value associated with the key `'key'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tOrdering:\n",
    "•\tList: Lists maintain the order of elements. The order in which items are added to the list is preserved, and you can access them in that order.\n",
    "•\tDictionary: Dictionaries do not guarantee any specific order of key-value pairs. In Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain insertion order, but you should not rely on this behavior for older Python versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tMutability:\n",
    "•\tList: Lists are mutable, which means you can change their contents by adding, removing, or modifying elements.\n",
    "•\tDictionary: Dictionaries are also mutable; you can add, remove, or update key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tKey-Value Mapping:\n",
    "•\tList: Lists are used for storing collections of similar or different types of items. Elements in a list are typically accessed sequentially using numeric indices.\n",
    "•\tDictionary: Dictionaries are used for mapping keys to values, making it easy to associate data with unique identifiers (keys). Keys can be of various data types, and they provide a way to look up values quickly without needing to know their position.\n"

In this case, it will either return the existing value of `'color'` or set it to `'black'` if it doesn't exist.
